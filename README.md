# Web-Audio-Api-Tests

A little Web Audio Api test. The goal was to make a monophonic synthesizer.

Run node index.mjs and go to localhost:8080

Click on the rectangle to make the synth appear and press the keys Q Z S E D F T G Y H U J to play notes from C to B (it's more intuitive to play it on an AZERTY layout). Press arrow down or up to change the octave accordingly.

The dockerfile was just a test, you don't need it.

The animation of the synth is broken and there's no limit to how far you can go in terms of octaves modulation. The goal was just to get to know the Web Audio Api.
